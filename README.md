Hospital project

This is a project I have worked on as a part of coursework. The idea and the aim of this project is to help a hospital manage its doctors, as well as patients.
It helps doctors manage scheduled appointments as well as prescribe therapies and medicine to patients that have visited them.
Admin can add and delete doctors as well as patients and can change their info.

This project was made with C#, while using Json files as database.
The views are made with HTML and CSS.
